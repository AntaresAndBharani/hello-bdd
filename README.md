Backtrader Algorithmic Trading Project
========================================

Overview
--------
This repository contains algorithmic trading strategies implemented using the Backtrader framework. The project is set up using VS Code Dev Containers to ensure a consistent development environment.

Environment Setup
-----------------
**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop
- Visual Studio Code
- Dev Containers extension for VS Code

**Development Environment:**
This project uses VS Code Dev Containers for development. The container provides:
- Python 3.x
- Essential Python extensions for VS Code
- Pre-installed packages for algorithmic trading (e.g., backtrader, yfinance, behave)

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Open in VS Code:
   - Open the cloned repository folder.
3. Reopen in Container:
   - When prompted by VS Code, select "Reopen in Container".
4. Install dependencies (if not automatically installed by the container):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Project Structure
-----------------
- `features/`
  - `hello_world.feature`: Behave feature file for a simple "Hello World" test.
  - `steps/`
    - `hello_world_steps.py`: Step definitions for the "Hello World" feature.
- `trading/`
  - `hello_world_strategy.py`: A basic Backtrader strategy that prints "Hello World".
  - `data_downloader.py`: Script to download historical data from Yahoo Finance.
- `strategies/`
  - (Additional strategies can be added here.)
- `data/`
  - (CSV files for downloaded historical data will be stored here.)

Dependencies
------------
All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Running Strategies
------------------
To run a strategy (for example, `hello_world.py`) directly:
   ```sh
   python hello_world.py
   ```
(Adjust the filename/path depending on where your script is located.)

Downloading Data
----------------
A script called `data_downloader.py` is available in the `trading` folder to download historical data from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library.

**Usage from the Command Line:**
From the project root (where `trading/` is a subfolder), run:
   ```sh
   python -m trading.data_downloader --ticker AAPL --start 2011-01-01 --end 2012-12-31 --output data/AAPL.csv
   ```

**Arguments:**
- `--ticker`  : The stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL).
- `--start`   : Start date for historical data in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- `--end`     : End date for historical data in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- `--output`  : The output CSV file path (e.g., data/AAPL.csv).

This command downloads the specified date range of historical data for the ticker and saves it as a CSV file under the `data/` folder.

BDD Testing with Behave
-----------------------
We use Behave to perform behavior-driven testing (BDD). The tests are located in the `features/` folder, with step definitions in `features/steps/`.

**Running Tests:**
To run all Behave tests, simply execute:
   ```sh
   behave
   ```
or
   ```sh
   python -m behave
   ```
or
   ```sh
   behave --format json --outfile reports/report.json
   ```
If you want a format.

**How the Tests Work:**
- **Feature File (`hello_world.feature`):**
  Defines the "Given/When/Then" steps in plain English.
- **Step Definitions (`hello_world_steps.py`):**
  Implements each step in Python.
  In the `@given` step, it calls the data-downloading function from `data_downloader.py` (if necessary) to ensure the CSV file is available before running the Backtrader strategy.
  The `@when` step runs the strategy.
  The `@then` step asserts that "Hello World" was printed (not yet fully implemented in the sample code).

By structuring your tests and data download in this way, you can ensure that each scenario has the required historical data ready before executing the Backtrader strategy.

## Code Coverage with `coverage.py`

You can measure how much of your Python code is exercised by Behave tests using the [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) tool.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install coverage

# .coveragerc
[run]
source = trading

[report]
show_missing = True
```
